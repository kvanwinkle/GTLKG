paragraph_1: "It all started with a visionâ€¦ \n\nWhen William Katz took the solo journey
  from Russia to the United States at 13 years of age, he knew the future of America
  was in the west. A cap maker by trade, William came to California and, by 1923,
  built his first property in East Los Angeles. With excellent foresight and unique
  business acumen, William, along with his two children, selected properties in what
  eventually became top SoCal neighborhoods. Now, nearly 100 years after an immigrant
  with a trade and a vision worked his way into a burgeoning real estate market, his
  descendants continue to build on his dreams. \n\nToday, GTL/KG Properties can be
  found in Beverly Hills, West Third Street, Melrose, Beverly Grove, Malibu, and Rancho
  Mirage. While some of our tenants are individual shops, more than 90% have multiple
  locations. The companies range from small businesses run by entrepreneurs like William
  Katz to publicly-traded, internationally-renowned corporations. Our screening process
  is extensive. We believe finding the right tenant for the right location helps build
  a vibrant, engaging neighborhood experience. Once we have found the perfect fit,
  we develop outreach programs to ensure our tenants integrate smoothly into their
  new community."
