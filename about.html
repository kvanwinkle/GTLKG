        <p> GTL/KG Properties is a family-operated real estate holdings company, specializing in premiere
properties across LA’s vibrant Westside. GTL/KG began in 1923, when Russian immigrant,
William Katz, built his first property in East LA. Although he was cap maker by trade, Katz
recognized the value of owning real estate in the ever-expanding Los Angeles market. Katz’s
two children soon took over the management of the properties, and when his grandchildren
joined the business in the late-1970s, the company began to flourish. </p>

<p>
Today GTL/KG properties can be found in Beverly Hills, West Third Street, Melrose, and Beverly
Grove. </p>
