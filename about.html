caption: GTL/KG founder William Katz at his first property in 1923.
paragraph_1: "It all started with a visionâ€¦ \n\n<br><br>\n\nWhen William Katz took
  the solo journey from Russia to the United States at 13 years of age, he knew the
  future of America was in the west. A cap maker by trade, William came to California
  and, by 1923, built his first property in East Los Angeles. With excellent foresight
  and unique business acumen, William, along with his two children, selected properties
  in what eventually became top SoCal neighborhoods. Now, nearly 100 years after an
  immigrant with a trade and a vision worked his way into a burgeoning real estate
  market, his descendants continue to build on his dreams. \n\n<br><br>\n\nToday,
  GTL/KG Properties can be found in Beverly Hills, West Third Street, Melrose, Beverly
  Grove, Malibu, and Rancho Mirage. While some of our tenants are individual shops,
  more than 90% have multiple locations. The companies range from small businesses
  run by entrepreneurs like William Katz to publicly-traded, internationally-renowned
  corporations. Our screening process is extensive. We believe finding the right tenant
  for the right location helps build a vibrant, engaging neighborhood experience.
  Once we have found the perfect fit, we develop outreach programs to ensure our tenants
  integrate smoothly into their new community."
