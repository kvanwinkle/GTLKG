paragraph_1: GTL/KG Properties is a family-operated real estate holdings company,
  specializing in premiere properties across LA’s vibrant Westside. GTL/KG began in
  1923, when Russian immigrant, William Katz, built his first property in East LA.
  Although he was cap maker by trade, Katz recognized the value of owning real estate
  in the ever-expanding Los Angeles market. Katz’s two children soon took over the
  management of the properties, and when his grandchildren joined the business in
  the late-1970s, the company began to flourish.
paragraph_2: Today GTL/KG properties can be found in Beverly Hills, West Third Street,
  Melrose, and Beverly Grove.

  to their individual neighborhoods.
