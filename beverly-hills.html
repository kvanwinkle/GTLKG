propertyHeader: Since 2007, GTL/KG has led the transformation of South Robertson Boulevard
  in Beverly Hills.
propertyDescription: When we acquired properties on Robertson in 2007, the area was
  best known for its abundance of beauty service practitioners. However, we recognized
  that this easily walkable and central location was an untapped market with the potential
  to become the hub of Southeast Beverly Hills. Our team set about actively recruiting
  top dining and retail tenants that today anchor the dynamic South Robertson neighborhood.
  <br><br> We’re proud to lead the way on South Robertson as we turn this corner of
  Beverly Hills into a 21st century hotspot.
